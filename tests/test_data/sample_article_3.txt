Depp moved to Los Angeles with his band when he was 20. After the band split up, Depp's then-wife Lori Ann Allison introduced him to actor Nicolas Cage.[17] After they became drinking buddies, Cage advised him to pursue acting.[37] Depp had been interested in acting since reading a biography of James Dean and watching Rebel Without a Cause.[38] Cage helped Depp get an audition with Wes Craven for A Nightmare on Elm Street; Depp, who had no acting experience, said he "ended up acting by accident".[39][40] Thanks in part to his catching the eye of Craven's daughter,[39] Depp landed the role of the main character's boyfriend, one of Freddy Krueger's victims.[17]

Although Depp said he "didn't have any desire to be an actor", he continued to be cast in films,[40] making enough to cover some bills that his musical career left unpaid.[39] After a starring role in the 1985 comedy Private Resort, Depp was cast in the lead role of the 1986 skating drama Thrashin' by the film's director, but its producer overrode the decision.[41][42] Instead, Depp appeared in a minor supporting role as a Vietnamese-speaking private in Oliver Stone's 1986 Vietnam War drama Platoon. He became a teen idol during the late 1980s, when he starred as an undercover police officer in a high school operation in the Fox television series 21 Jump Street, which premiered in 1987.[17] He accepted this role to work with actor Frederic Forrest, who inspired him. Despite his success, Depp felt that the series "forced [him] into the role of product".[43]
