When late substitute C. Kelly saved England's Euros defence in 103 seconds against Sweden on Thursday night, it proved two things.

Firstly, how good the 27-year-old is on the pitch. And secondly, how important her happiness is off the field.

Those who only follow the Lionesses at major tournaments may be unaware of how close the woman who scored the winner in the Euro 2022 final was to not being cast in the sequel three years later. In the first England squad of 2025, Kelly was not selected amid a crisis at club level.

Her return is the perfect example of how when a player is happy off the field, they thrive on it.

In February, Sarina Wiegman left Kelly out of her squad for Nations League games against Portugal and Spain. At the time, she had not played any football since mid-December, having made just one Women's Super League start in the first half of 2024-25.

Kelly fell out of favour at former club Manchester City under ex-manager Gareth Taylor. She secured a loan to childhood team Arsenal, having posted emotional messages to social media saying she "wanted to be happy again" and accusing City of planting negative stories about her in the media., external

She was eventually selected for the February squad when Beth Mead dropped out, and 13 appearances for Arsenal in the back half of the campaign - including starting the Gunners' Champions League final triumph over Barcelona - was enough to earn her place at Euro 2025. She has since joined Arsenal on a permanent deal.

If Wiegman had not brought Kelly back England would now be out of the Euros, after she made the difference against Sweden.

As Karen Bardsley said in 5 Live's quarter-final commentary: "England have to keep going and keep getting the ball to Chloe Kelly."

Team-mate Esme Morgan was effusive in her praise following Kelly's decisive performance.

"She's been training amazingly in the last few days," Morgan, Kelly's former Man City club-mate, told BBC Sport. "So she was high on confidence coming into that game.

"She seems to thrive on those moments when the team needs her to pull a performance out of the bag. She was just incredible when she came on."
